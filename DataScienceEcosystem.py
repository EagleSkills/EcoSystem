# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem 

# ## Introductroy
# in this notebook,A data ecosystem refers to a combination of enterprise infrastructure and applications that are      utilized to aggregate and analyze information

# ### Objectives
# 
# * AI-driven modern data ecosystem enables an organization to generate maximum business value from its unique data assets.
# 
# * Higher returns. Businesses can generate higher returns with more effective monetization of data and by unlocking value in legacy data stores. 
# 
# * Cost savings. Organizations can reduce capital expenses and contain data warehouse costs by transitioning to the cloudâ€”rationalizing and simplifying the data landscape.
# 
# * Speed to market and to value. Faster insights through AI-enabled data engineering can reduce time to market.
# 
# * Customer engagement. With a modern data ecosystem, businesses can better understand customer and market behavior and use it to enhance their product or service offerings to better meet changing consumer needs and preferences.
# 
# * Process improvement. Analyzing big data sets in a modern data ecosystem can optimize and improve internal operations, such as supply chain management and inventory management.
